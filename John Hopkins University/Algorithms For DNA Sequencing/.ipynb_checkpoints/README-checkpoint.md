ALGORITHMS FOR DNA SEQUENCING

This file contains codes created for completing the various tasks required to complete the course

WEEK 1
1. Basics of working with String & manipulating DNA strands as string such as finding the reverse complement of the string
2. Algorithms for parsing a genome from a 'fasta' file and sequencing reads from a 'fastq' file
3. Creating charts to observe the number of time a quality score was found in a sequencing read & observing the GC content per base. Furthermore, algorithms for conversion of quality score to ASCII & vice-versa was written.
4. Matching artificial reads to a genome
5. Matching real reads to a genome. Warning signs such as change in reads due to sequencing errors, double-stranded nature of DNA was also taken into considerations when matching the reads.
